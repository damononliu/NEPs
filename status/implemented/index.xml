Abstract # Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the Constantinople, St. Petersburg and Istanbul hardforks. The proposed changes for NewChain&amp;rsquo;s Boom upgrade include:
Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM Skinny CREATE2 EXTCODEHASH opcode Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps Add Blake2 compression function F precompile Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs Add ChainID opcode Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes Calldata gas cost reduction Rebalance net-metered SSTORE gas cost with consideration of SLOAD gas cost change This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the NewChain networks:</description></item><item><title>Change On Community Node NEW Unlocking Period</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-43/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-43/</guid><description>Simple Summary # This proposal changes the Community Node NEW unlocking period from 14 days to 7 days for owners and partners to unlock their staked NEW. Making the unlocking period the same as voters to unlock their staked NEW.
Abstract # In NewPay App, unlock NEW for Community Node owners/partners from their staked NEW will be changed from 14 days to 7 days to help them to get their NEW back faster.</description></item><item><title>Improvement to Newton Foundation Reserved Token Release Rules</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-1/</guid><description>Summary: # In order to ensure the scarcity and reasonable liquidity of Newton tokens (NEW), based on the ideas and opinions of all parties, the following suggestions are put forth to modify the token release rules.
Details: # The plan for Newton Foundation reserved token release as stated in the Newton White Paper V0.5 is that â€œ1/2 of the total is immediately unlocked, while the rest will be unlocked 1/12 every month.</description></item><item><title>NEP Genesis</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-0/</guid><description>Summary: # For the sake of the open, transparent governance, we propose compiling all suggestions related to the Newton Project using the Newton Evolution Proposal (NEP) template for unified numbering and management. The proposals are then put to the community for broader discussion, getting opinions and suggestions from all parties involved before forming final conclusions.
Details: # Anyone can submit an NEP. The Newton Foundation is responsible for assigning an exclusive number to each.</description></item><item><title>NewChain Ledger Node Incentive Program</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-45/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-45/</guid><description>Simple Summary # This NEP defines how NewChain Ledger Node Incentive is used from Newton Incentive Program in NEP-40.
Motivation # NEP-40 proposed Newton Incentive Program and a 20% of NEW from that program will be used to NewChain Ledger Nodes. A specification of implementation is required for that, which comes to this NewChain Ledger Node Incentive Program.
Specification # Prerequisites for Ledger Node # Having an active Community Node.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Updates on Community Node and vote</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-47/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-47/</guid><description>Simple Summary # This proposal contains parameter changes on community node mining, including NEW staking period, mining reward calculation, and minumam lock amount.
Abstract # Changes on NewPay:
Change NEW staking period on community node and vote. Change minumam lock amount on community node and vote to 10000 NEW. Change community node NF factor to 1, same as community vote NF factor. Motivation # NewChain MainNet ledger nodes are open to public since NEP-27 has been implemented.</description></item></channel></rss>
